*PAR:	that if she hadn't picked. 162806_163932

*PAR:	that she was going to wake her grandmother up. 204169_206354
*PAR:	so <she played> [//] she tapped on her possibly. 206354_211935
*PAR:	but it was really a wolf. 211935_213810
*PAR:	it wasn't her grandmother. 213810_214900

*PAR:	couldn't see anything else there. 245200_252685
*PAR:	&oh wait <RES> [e] &=laughs maybe he didn't eat her. 252685_259565
*PAR:	maybe he ate the cake and wine. 259565_263515

*PAR:	<RES> [e]. 266801_268992
*PAR:	okay so (.) it looks like maybe the guy cut. 268992_278412
*PAR:	&-oh and so the happy villager came along. 278412_283117
*PAR:	and cut open the wolf. 283117_284492
*PAR:	and out came grandma and Little Red Riding Hood. 284492_287441
*PAR:	and the wolf is dead. 287441_291652
*PAR:	although he's awfully happy for being dead. 291652_294272
*PAR:	&-oh once they got the grandmother out and Little Red Riding Hood. 294272_300673
*PAR:	they went and got a bunch of &-um stones. 300673_303252

*PAR:	his belly was full of stones instead of grandmother and Red Riding
	Hood. 316252_323047
*PAR:	and it caused havoc on his intestines. 323047_325208
*PAR:	and it looks like he might have fallen into a well. 325208_328253
*PAR:	&-oh i'm supposed to ignore the top one. 328253_330738
*PAR:	<RES> [e]. 330738_334279
