*PAR:	There is birthday cake with a candle on it. 0_6141
*PAR:	which is saying chapter one. 6141_7220
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood was given a cape by her grandmother. 7220_15970
*PAR:	and all the birds admired this cape greatly. 15970_19801
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother was so proud of how cute her
	little granddaughter was. 19801_26546
*PAR:	that she constantly exclaimed in surprise. 26546_30371
*PAR:	and then Little Red Riding Hood went outside. 30371_33356
*PAR:	to show off her cape to all the other nature friends. 33356_38282
*PAR:	in addition to those birds admiring her from the window. 38282_41531
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood went out with a picnic basket full of goodies. 41531_52371
*PAR:	including a bottle of wine, which she was too young for. 52371_58281
*PAR:	so a bottle with a &=laughs stopper in it so that she would not
	expire from thirst. 58281_64607
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood's mother waved her goodbye. 64607_67572
*PAR:	because her grandmother was too infirm to leave the house. 67572_71248
*PAR:	and as always, Little Red Riding Hood's bird friends &-uh observed
	her as she went. 71248_80463
*PAR:	she waved farewell on this lovely &-mm spring day. 80463_86889
*PAR:	probable spring (be)cause it's green on this lovely spring day. 86889_89465
*PAR:	&-uh not knowing what doom was in store for her. 89465_95595
*PAR:	as Little Red Riding Hood blithely sauntered through the woods with
	her picnic basket in tow. 95595_107014
*PAR:	all the creatures of the woods observed her. 107014_110154
*PAR:	<because the &-uh> [/] because the forest thicket was so dense. 110154_117714
*PAR:	the birds did not follow her in. 117714_120109
*PAR:	so of her animal guardians she was only followed by a bunny rabbit
	and a squirrel. 120109_127734
*PAR:	this was insufficient deterrent for the &-uh perils of the forest. 127734_135514
*PAR:	which she encountered alonf the way. 135514_137214
*PAR:	including a furious woodsman with an ax. 137214_142359
*PAR:	who was &-uh upset. 142359_145559
*PAR:	that she was infringing upon his right of way. 145559_148089
*PAR:	as she walked through the path in the forest. 148089_151059
*PAR:	and a maddened wolf. 151059_153859
*PAR:	who salivated. 153859_155433
*PAR:	man, he's not salivating too much. 155433_159883
*PAR:	alright we'll say he's salivating anyway. 159883_163349
*PAR:	because it makes the story better. 163349_164963
*PAR:	who salivated massively. 164963_167958
*PAR:	as he stalked her throughout the forest. 167958_171334
*PAR:	yet Little Red Riding Hood continued again. 171334_174788
*PAR:	still unaware of the doom that lay in store for her. 174788_178678
*PAR:	as Little Red Riding Hood proceeded through the woods blithely as
	usual. 178678_188483
*PAR:	the wolf who had recently had a tremendously good, but evil, but
	brilliant idea. 188483_195688
*PAR:	&-um somewhat expeditiously &-uh bounded his way towards Little Red
	Riding Hood's undefended home. 195688_206069
*PAR:	The  birds observed this. 206069_208300
*PAR:	but their tweeting was an insufficiently loud alarm. 208300_211924
*PAR:	because Little Red Riding Hood had a hood. 211924_215879
*PAR:	that was too tight over her ears. 215879_217510
*PAR:	and so she couldn't hear the birds talking about how the [/] the
	&-uh wolf was sneaking into her dwelling. 217510_226879
*PAR:	The wolf attacked Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother. 226879_235740
*PAR:	because her mother was nowhere to be seen either. 235740_239240
*PAR:	and the grandmother was left undefended. 239240_244209
*PAR:	the wolf &-uh cast himself towards her with his devouring jaws open.
	244209_251790
*PAR:	and gobbled her up immediately. 251790_254870
*PAR:	which mercifully was not illustrated here. 254870_257245
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood having returned from her picnic expidition to
	gather flowers. 257245_267336
*PAR:	came back to her home. 267336_269521
*PAR:	&-um she brought the bottle back for some reason. 269521_275336
*PAR:	and set up a nice little lunchtime snack spread for her grandmother
	with fresh baked cookies. 275336_284086
*PAR:	which she had bought at the farmer's market on the other side of the
	forest apparently. 284086_289076
*PAR:	and &-uh set up a nice bouquet of flowers. 289076_292817
*PAR:	that she had collected. 292817_294196
*PAR:	while blithely sauntering through the forest. 294196_296326
*PAR:	the mice that customarily lived in the house crept out from under
	the bed. 296326_302666
*PAR:	interested very much in those cookies. 302666_306335
*PAR:	although somewhat alarmed by the flowers. 306335_308616
*PAR:	because as it appears. 308616_310836
*PAR:	the mice were offended by the &-uh interior decor of the flower pot. 310836_316895
*PAR:	&-um the mice were dwelling in this dwelling. 316895_324446
*PAR:	because they were not cast out by a cat. 324446_328336
*PAR:	and the evidence in this picture. 328336_332242
*PAR:	that show there was no cat available. 332242_334243
*PAR:	is that there [/] there was a ball of yarn. 334243_337742
*PAR:	which was undamaged by cat claws. 337742_341832
*PAR:	so this is why the mice ran rampant. 341832_343912
*PAR:	however Little Red Riding Hood's family were in balance. 343912_347573
*PAR:	and in tune with nature. 347573_348883
*PAR:	and did not mind too much. 348883_350542
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood was so intent on setting up a good surprise
	for her grandmother. 350542_357287
*PAR:	and doing so very quietly. 357287_359818
*PAR:	so that she would not wake her grandmother from her sleep. 359818_363633
*PAR:	that she did not notice at all. 363633_365863
*PAR:	that there was a wolf in the bed instead of her grandmother. 365863_370623
*PAR:	and the wolf &-uh did not have the purest of intentions. 370623_375372
*PAR:	not only not towards the [/] the flower pot like the mice. 375372_379442
*PAR:	who didn't like the flower pot. 379442_380622
*PAR:	but he was going to devour the cookies and Little Red Riding Hood. 380622_384543
*PAR:	just like he'd devoured her grandmother. 384543_386873
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood went to wake up her grandmother. 386873_392943
*PAR:	because she was too impatient to share the delicious meal. 392943_396653
*PAR:	and didn't want to let her grandmother to sleep any long. 396653_399828
*PAR:	and i mean ten minutes is enought for anybody. 399828_401923
*PAR:	right? 401923_402248
*PAR:	so she snuck up to wake up her grandmother. 402248_405204
*PAR:	and came close to the bed. 405204_407778
*PAR:	while sort of  wondering. 407778_409653
*PAR:	why her grandmother had suddenly developed so much ear hair all of a
	sudden. 409653_413998
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood was startled. 413998_420093
*PAR:	when the wolf leapt out of bed towards her. 420093_423673
*PAR:	wearing her grandmother's nightgown. 423673_426173
*PAR:	and he dashed aside the nightstand. 426173_429069
*PAR:	as he chased her. 429069_430444
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood's cape was insufficiently superhero like to
	allow her to escape. 430444_437144
*PAR:	and she rushed with all her might on her two little Red Riding Hood
	legs. 437144_443519
*PAR:	as the [/] the wolf dashed towards her. 443519_447334
*PAR:	when the hunter came in with his dog. 447334_456334
*PAR:	having heard all the commotion. 456334_457519
*PAR:	and &-uhm having been summoned by the local wildlife. 457519_462489
*PAR:	as is evidenced by the squirrel lying. 462489_466769
*PAR:	standing upon the night stand. 466769_468774
*PAR:	the hunter crept in. 468774_472239
*PAR:	not knowing what he would find. 472239_474364
*PAR:	and even the hunting dog was sensible enought. 474364_477518
*PAR:	to hide behind the door. 477518_478769
*PAR:	as he came in. 478769_480644
*PAR:	the hunter saw the wolf had gorged himself. 480644_484284
*PAR:	and was lying sated upon the bed. 484284_487614
*PAR:	snoring tremendously. 487614_490459
*PAR:	&-uh <so out of this> [//] so out of it. 490459_495080
*PAR:	that he was not at all a hazard to the birds. 495080_500489
*PAR:	which [/] which crept merrily upon his belly. 500489_503835
*PAR:	&-uh looking for ticks. 503835_505776
*PAR:	as though they were the little birds. 505776_507651
*PAR:	that live on the back of [/] of hippopatomasuses. 507651_511576
*PAR:	i think. 511576_512077
*PAR:	and the hunter came in. 512077_514121
*PAR:	not knowing what would happen. 514121_516231
*PAR:	but ready to [/] to come to the defense of his neighbors against the
	[/] the treacherous wildlife. 516231_523606
*PAR:	which he knew dwelled in the environs. 523606_526526
*PAR:	but at the end. 526526_531996
*PAR:	my goodness this is like the movie Alien. 531996_536296
*PAR:	&=laughs wow i've got to conceptualize this for a second. 536296_543526
*PAR:	okay alright. 543526_546732
*PAR:	&-uh but despite his [/] his weaponry of hunting. 546732_553152
*PAR:	the [/] the huntsman instead was able to make use of the
	grandmother's sewing basket or &-uh knitting basket. 553152_562231
*PAR:	which had sheers in it. 562231_564607
*PAR:	and mercifully the grandmother did not have those dainty little
	scissors. 564607_568527
*PAR:	that you use for cutting thread. 568527_569997
*PAR:	but no she had sewing shears in her knitting basket. 569997_572937
*PAR:	which was convenient at this time. 572937_574952
*PAR:	because the hunter was able to use it. 574952_577277
*PAR:	to perfom quick surgery upon the wolf. 577277_579828
*PAR:	and rescue the grandmother. 579828_584732
*PAR:	and Little Red Riding Hood herself as well. 584732_588833
*PAR:	they both leapt with glee from the wolf's stomach. 588833_593523
*PAR:	&-uh &-uh magically cleaned of [/] of entrails and such from the
	wolf. 593523_600863
*PAR:	and the wolf himself was blissfully snoozing still. 600863_605263
*PAR:	and did not realize it. 605263_606983
*PAR:	which only goes to show. 606983_608683
*PAR:	that whatever was in those cookies was good enough sedative for this. 608683_612764
*PAR:	and it should have been patented by a drug company for surgery. 612764_616263
*PAR:	and they all lived happily ever after. 616263_619263
*PAR:	including apparently the wolf. 619263_621013
*PAR:	oh my goodness the story is not over. 621013_626703
*PAR:	in order to make up for the
	[/] the &-uh wolf's sudden lack of [/] of belly filling. 626703_635809
*PAR:	the [/] the hunter who did feel rather sorry for the wolf after all.
	635809_640944
*PAR:	&-um decided to use some of the landscaping stones. 640944_646970
*PAR:	that were found in Little Red Riding Hood's family's garden. 646970_650985
*PAR:	Not to mention the fact that as a neighbor the [/] the hunter had
	found those landscaping stones to be an eyesore. 650985_658890
*PAR:	and wanted to get rid of them anyway. 658890_661260
*PAR:	so he put them inside the wolf's stomach. 661260_664340
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood helped. 664340_666530
*PAR:	because frankly her grandmother was the only one in the family. 666530_669605
*PAR:	who liked those landscaping stones anyway. 669605_671930
*PAR:	and even the huntsman's dog was happy to bring them. 671930_675261
*PAR:	although he had to be &-um persuaded not to go chasing them around
	the yard for tow hours. 675261_681635
*PAR:	because after all this those cookies would only last so long in
	keeping the wolf asleep. 681635_686965
*PAR:	then the grandmother came with her [/] her needle and thread. 686965_691965
*PAR:	to darn up the wolf's stomach. 691965_693821
*PAR:	on the [/] the assumption that he had so much fur. 693821_697648
*PAR:	that he would never be able to see the seam anyway. 697648_700056
*PAR:	and all of the humans and dog were [/] were massively pleased with
	themselves about this plan. 700056_707556
*PAR:	at [//] &-uh after the wolf woke up. 707556_715746
*PAR:	he [/] he &-um [/] he left the house felling sated but bloated. 715746_723056
*PAR:	and Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother and the huntsman. 723056_728556
*PAR:	&-uh &-uh chortled mightily. 728556_730651
*PAR:	as they hid in the shrubbery. 730651_732936
*PAR:	watching the wolf stagger along. 732936_735181
*PAR:	the dog was somewhat perplexed at this. 735181_738746
*PAR:	but &-um &-uh did not seem inclined to do anything about it. 738746_744606
*PAR:	the wolf &-um was unsure why <such tender young> [//] such a tender
	young lady was sitting so [/] so unsettlingly on his stomach. 744606_758496
*PAR:	so he lumbered his gastrointestinally unhappy way towards the well. 758496_764877
*PAR:	in hopes of  getting soem water to wash down some antacids with. 764877_769157
*PAR:	after the wolf &-m &-uh wandered away to [/] to slowly [/] slowly
	digest the appaling landscape stones. 769157_785207
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood and her grandmother &-um siad farewell to the
	woodsman. 785207_796453
*PAR:	the &-uh birds and local wildlife waved farewell. 796453_801598
*PAR:	and as the woodsman walked away. 801598_804873
*PAR:	Little Red Riding Hood came with a basket of ice cream. 804873_810578
*PAR:	I suppose to [/] to take home to the huntsman and his [/] his larger
	stable of dogs. 810578_818498
*PAR:	&-uh so that they would all have a nice little party. 818498_822747
*PAR:	&-um in celebration of rescuing from the wolf. 822747_826828
*PAR:	The grandmother who did not particularly feel like walking that far
	in those uncomfortable old fasioned shoes. 826828_834328
*PAR:	bid them a happy farewell and went back inside to her knitting.
