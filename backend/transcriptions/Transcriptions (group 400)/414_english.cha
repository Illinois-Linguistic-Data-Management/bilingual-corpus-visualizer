*PAR:	she was the apple of her grandmother's eye. 12506_15148
*PAR:	and her grandmother, to show he much she loved the little girl, made

*PAR:	that she could wear all over the place that she wanted to. 22053_24757
*PAR:	<and she earned this> [//] and she did wear it all the time. 24757_27662

*PAR:	one day her mother sent her off with a basket of goodies. 29817_42647
*PAR:	to go visit her grandmother. 42647_44023

*PAR:	and cheer her up. 55238_56148
*PAR:	So Little Red Riding Hood, wearing her red cape with hood

*PAR:	the wolf came up with a second [/] &-uh second plan. 106805_110634
