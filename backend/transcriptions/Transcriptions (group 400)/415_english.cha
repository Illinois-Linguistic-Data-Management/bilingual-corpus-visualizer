*:	the wolf realized. 132962_134012
*:	that she [/] she was headed to the grandmother's house. 134012_136643
*:	and so he decides. 136643_138074
*:	to go to the grandmother's house early. 138074_139599

*:	Little Red Riding hood was surprised. 188616_191916
*:	when she looked at her grandmother. 191916_194007
*:	because something seemed a little bit odd. 194007_195908
*:	and so she decided. 195908_198574
*:	to ask the grandmother. 198574_199644
*:	about why she looked so different than normal. 199644_202469
*:	the wolf said. 202469_209371
*:	+= i am going to eat you. 209371_211415
*:	and jumped out of bed. 211415_212540
*:	and went after Little Red Riding Hood. 212540_214446
*:	luckily the hunter came by with his trusty dog. 214446_221526
*:	saw that the wolf had indeed swallowed (.) Little Red Riding Hood
	and the grandmother. 221526_226647
*:	because he was so fat. 226647_228487
*:	the hunter cut open (.) the wolf. 228487_237408
*:	and the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood jumped out 237408_239276
*:	and were saved. 239276_240658
*:	&=laughs (.) <and they> [//] and the hunter decided to put stones in
	the place of the grandmother and the Little Red Riding Hood. 240658_254068
*:	&-uhm the hunter put stones in the stomache. 254068_256960
*:	and sewed him back up. 256960_258009
*:	<and so> [//] and the dog had brought all the stones in for him. 258009_261840
*:	and so did Little Red Riding Hood. 261840_263250
*:	and the grandmother sewed him up, actually. 263250_265381
*:	they all worked together. 265381_266581
*:	to fool the wolf &=laughs. 266581_268302
*:	and the wolf left. 268302_273552
*:	thinking he had a big meal. 273552_274163
*:	and was all happy. 274163_275694
*:	and the hunter and the grandmother and Little Red Riding Hood
	laughed and laughed. 275694_278564
*:	because they weren't the ones inside of the wolf. 278564_280395
*:	the ones inside of the wolf, stones were. 280395_282960
*:	<RES> [e]. 282960_286916
*:	&-uh Little Red Riding Hood said goodbye to grandmother. 286916_290710

*:	to make sure she was safe. 293116_294586
